For Memory overcommit
---------------------

When free memory is enough (e.g., >50%), steal-report cold memory.  This will
decrease free memory of the system.  If a entire memory block is stole-reported
and memmap_on_mem, further hot-remove the block to free up 'struct page'
objects.

If free memory is insufficient (e.g., <51%), do proactive reclaim of cold
memory.  This will increase free memory.

If free memory is further decreasing despite of proactive reclaim (e.g., <20%),
and there are stole-reported memory, give those back.  If there's no
stole-reported memory but hot-unplugged memory, hot-plug it back.  Else, the
user selected wrong instance.


For tiered memory
-----------------

For each node,

If the node is the lowest node, proactive-reclaim the node, aiming some
reasonable low level of pressure stall.  On memory overcommitted system, the
above steal-report can also be used.  It will hot-unplug the entire node and
make upper node the lowest node.

If the node is not the lowest node, demote cold pages to lower node, aiming
some free memory of current node.  E.g., 5% free memory ratio of this node.

If the node is not the highest node, promote hot pages to upper node, aiming
high utilization of the upper node.
