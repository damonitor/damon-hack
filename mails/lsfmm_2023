Subject: [LSF/MM/BPF TOPIC] DAMON Updates and Future Plans

Hi all,


DAMON has merged into mainline as a data access monitoring tool that equips a
best-effort overhead-accuracy tradeoff mechanism, and then extended for data
access-aware system operations.  I'd like to briefly introduce current state of
DAMON and share/discuss about 2023 plans including below.

- Finer and easier-to-use DAMOS tuning
  - tuning aggressiveness based on user or kernel feed (e.g., QPS or PSI)
- Merging DAMON user space tool into the mainline
- Extending DAMON
  - Page-granularity monitoring
    - LRU-lists based page-granulariy monitoring
  - CPU-specific access monitoring
  - Read/Write-only access monitoring
- More DAMON-based Operation Schemes
  - Tiered memory management
  - THP memory footprint reduction
  - NUMA balancing

I hope to hear concerns/interests about the plans for prioritizing each work
items and get some suggestions of future works and collaboration with other
kernel subsystems/hackers.


Thanks,
SJ
