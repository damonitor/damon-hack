Subject: Looking back DAMON development in 2023

Hello,


Last year around this time, I shared a humble retrospect of DAMON for 2022[1],
which was the effectively the first year it had after it being merged in the
mainline.  As one more year has passed, I'd like to share that again for the
second year of DAMON, with some events and statistics of this year's DAMON
development that I was personally interested.  I'd like to also use this chance
to say huge thanks to the community.

Summary
=======

2023 was yet another year of active and healthy DAMON development.  DAMON has
hopefully more stabilized but continued active development.  The growth of the
DAMON user-space tool, damo, was especially impressive.

DAMON has explored and used by more people and products.  DAMON user-space
tool, damo[2], got its 100th GitHub star, and deployed by seven major Linux
distros' packaging systems.  Four papers and three articles that explore and/or
introduce DAMON have published by peope other than the maintainer of DAMON.  A
product that managing tiered memory using DAMON has officially released.

Substantial amount of development was also continued.  Four major DAMON kernel
side features have developed.  Signficant amount of new features for damo has
added.  Damo has also released its second major version (v2.0).

24 people contributed their great code to DAMON via making 158 commits merged
into the mainline.  About 26% of the commits were made by Amazon-external
contributors.

About 0.2% of the commits for whole Linux tree was made for DAMON.  Among the
changes for DAMON's parent subsystem, mm, about 9.5% of commits and 8.3% of
changed lines were made for DAMON.

Six people contributed 1,874 commits to DAMON user-space tool, damo.

Compared to 2022, the absolute number of contributors and changes for DAMON in
kernel space has reduced (about 40%), though the proportion of the numbers
against its parent subsystem, mm, and the entire Linux tree was increased
(about 10%) or remained.  Meanwhile, the numbers for the user-space tool, damo,
has hugely increased (about 500% and 80% for contributors and changes,
respectively).

Key Events
==========

DAMON user-space tool, damo[2], got significant achievements in 2023.  'damo'
was deployed via PyPI since 2021 August, and ArchLinux started packaing it
since 2022 March[3].  In 2023, Fedora has been the second major Linux distro
that packaging the tool since May[4].  The tool has pacakaged by more distros,
and as of this writing, ArchLinux, Debian, Devuan, Fedora, Kali Linux,
Raspbian, and Ubuntu are[5] packaging the tool.  It also got it's 100th
release[6] and GitHub star in August.

A few articles and papers introducing or exploring DAMON have published.  Two
LWN articles[7,8] that briefly introducing a new feature of DAMON as a
significant change of a new Linux kernel release, and sharing detailed LSFMM
DAMON discussion, respectively, have published in March and May.  A blog
post[9] from Hocus that briefly exploring DAMON as a way for reducing memory
footprint on virtual machines together with free pages reporting has published
in July.  Two arXiv papers[11,12] and one SOSP paper[3] exploring DAMON on
tiered memory management have published in February, September, and Octover,
respectively.  One more paper from Intel that improving DAMON for terabyte
scale memory system has published by ArXiv in November[13].

We shared DAMON and its future plans in multiple venues.  We shared the
development status and plans with other kernel developers at LSFMM[14] and
Kernel Summit on LinuxPlumbers[15] in May and November, respectively.  We
introduced DAMON in high level for wider audiences at Open Source Summit North
America[16] and Europe[17] in May and September, respectively.  In
LinuxPlumbers, we had the second in-person DAMON community meetup[18], which
doubled the number of attendees compared to the one we had in 2022.

DAMON community also started committing[19] to the stable kernels release
candidates testing since August.

SK Hynix has released[28] their second major version of Heterogeneous Memory
Software Development Kit (HMSDK), which uses DAMON for their CXL-based tiered
memory management, just a few days before this writing.  Maybe that's the first
official product level tiered memory management usage of DAMON.

A list of more detailed events in 2023 is available at the DAMON news web
page[29].

Key Features
============

We started 2023 with Linux v6.2 that delivered DAMOS tried regions
feature[20] that developed in 2022.

DAMOS filters[21] feature has developed and merged in the mainline by v6.3-rc1,
which was released in March.  The feature has later expanded[22] for more use
cases and merged in the mainline by v6.6-rc1, which was released in September.

Two more DAMON features for pseudo-moving average based reliable and speedy
DAMON snapshot generation[23] and DAMOS-independent apply time interval[24]
have developed and merged in the mainline by v6.7-rc1, which was reelased in
November.

Finally, we developed user feedback-based DAMOS aggressiveness auto-tuning[25],
which currently merged in the mm tree.  Hopefully it will be merged in the
mainline by v6.8-rc1, which expected to be released in January.

Development Statistics
======================

To appreciate and list all names of people who made DAMON available, and to
quantify what 2023 was for DAMON development, I collected some numbers using my
humble and buggy scripts.  The scripts are available as open source[26,27].

Please note that numbers don't say everything.  Nonetheless, in my humble
opinions, those are better than nothing, and fun ;)

Contributors
------------

According to the humble script, 24 people have contributed to DAMON development
in 2023 (v6.2-rc2..v6.7-rc7).

    # 24 authors, 158 commits in total

The last line of the output for 2022[3] was as below.

    # 40 authors, 275 commits in total

The number has quite reduced compared to that of 2022 (40 -> 24).  That's maybe
because the community is shrinking, or hopefully because DAMON code has much
more stabilized.

For the DAMON user-space tool, damo, six people contributed 1,859 commits in
2023.

    $ ./lazybox/git_helpers/authors.py ./damo --since 2023-01-01

    # 11 authors, 1859 commits in total

The numbers for 2022 were as below.

    $ ./lazybox/git_helpers/authors.py ./damo \
            --since 2022-01-01 --until 2022-12-31 --skip_merge_commits

    4. SeongJae Park <sjpark@amazon.de>: 1 commits
    # 4 authors, 1054 commits in total

So the number of commits and the commits have increased to about 180 percent
(1,054 -> 1,859) and 600 percent (1 -> 6) respectively, compared to those of
2022.  I'd call this a huge increase.

Please note that there were many more unsung hero contributors who gave
valuable inputs, discussions, and many more things for DAMON development.  So
shame that I cannot put everyone's name here.

Thank you so much to all awesome contributors!

Contributions from non-maintainer
---------------------------------

The maintainer, SJ (sj@kernel.org), has driven the development of DAMON, but
helps from the community were huge.  About 26.56% of DAMON commits have made by
people other than SJ.  Again, the number is reduced compared to that of last
year (33% -> 26%).

    $ ./damon-hack/stat_damon_portion_community_commits.sh \
            ./linux ./damon-hack/stat_branches_2023
    range           from_sj non_sj  non_sj_portion

    v6.1..v6.7-rc1  141     51      26.56 %

The output for 2022 was as below.

Portion of DAMON Commits in MM and Linux
----------------------------------------

To show how much change DAMON made to its parent subsystem, MM, and whole
Linux, I counted the number of commits that touched mm/damon, mm/ and any file
of the Linux tree in 2022 releases (v5.15..v6.2-rc1).  Note that I counted
changes touching only mm/damon/ and mm/ for DAMON and MM appropriately (doesn't
count changes for documents, headers, tests, etc), for simplicity.

According to the buggy and humble script, about 9.50% of MM commits, and 0.21%
of Linux commits were made for DAMON.

    $ ./damon-hack/stat_damon_portion_nr_commits.sh \
            ./linux ./damon-hack/stat_branches_2023
    range             damon    mm      damon/mm    linux    damon/linux
    v6.1..v6.2        31       287     10.80%      15536    0.20%
    v6.2..v6.3        47       401     11.72%      14424    0.33%
    v6.3..v6.4        5        288     1.74%       14835    0.03%
    v6.4..v6.5        26       299     8.70%       13561    0.19%
    v6.5..v6.6        25       361     6.93%       14069    0.18%
    v6.6..v6.7-rc1    47       270     17.41%      15418    0.30%
    v6.1..v6.7-rc1    181      1906    9.50%       87843    0.21%

The output for 2022 was as below.

    range               damon mm   damon/mm linux  damon/linux
    v5.15..v5.16        45    307  14.66%   14190  0.32%
    v5.16..v5.17        17    223  7.62%    13038  0.13%
    v5.17..v5.18        29    448  6.47%    14954  0.19%
    v5.18..v5.19        24    399  6.02%    15134  0.16%
    v5.19..v6.0         15    283  5.30%    15402  0.10%
    v6.0..v6.1          61    536  11.38%   13942  0.44%
    v6.1..v6.2-rc1      20    250  8.00%    13687  0.15%
    v5.15..v6.2-rc1     211   2446 8.63%    100347 0.21%

Compared to the numbers for 2022, absolute number of DAMON commits has slightly
reduced (211 -> 181), but the proportion of DAMON commits against MM commits
has increased (8.63% -> 9.50%), while the portion against Linux has not changed
(0.21%).

By Number of Lines
------------------

I further counted the portion of the number of changed lines.  Didn't count
that for Linux here due to the slow speed of the script.  Please also note that
I count changes touching only mm/damon/ and mm/ as same to the above case.  The
script argues about 8.31% of the changes lines for MM subsystem were for DAMON.
This is a quite decrease compared to that of last year (14.32%).  Hopefully
that's because DAMON became more stabilized.

    $ ./damon-hack/stat_damon_portion_lines.sh \
            ./linux ./damon-hack/stat_branches_2023
    range             damon    mm       damon/mm
    v6.1..v6.2        3309     11183    29.59%
    v6.2..v6.3        962      13213    7.28%
    v6.3..v6.4        32       14226    0.22%
    v6.4..v6.5        113      9852     1.15%
    v6.5..v6.6        322      7862     4.10%

    v6.1..v6.7-rc1    5521     66444    8.31%

The output for 2022 was as below.

    range               damon mm    damon/mm
    v5.15..v5.16        2157  8503  25.37%
    v5.16..v5.17        324   9370  3.46%
    v5.17..v5.18        3462  16288 21.25%
    v5.18..v5.19        929   10185 9.12%
    v5.19..v6.0         870   8665  10.04%
    v6.0..v6.1          1752  25844 6.78%
    v6.1..v6.2-rc1      3309  10544 31.38%
    v5.15..v6.2-rc1     12803 89399 14.32%

Conclusion
==========

DAMON community delivered a number of important features and quite a number of
changes to the world via the collaboration between the 26 great contributors.
I would call 2023 as one of the successful and grateful years of DAMON
development.

Huge thanks to you again, DAMON community.  Looking forward to continuing our
journey in 2023.

Hope you all enjoy the remaining holidays and happy new year!


Thanks,
SJ
