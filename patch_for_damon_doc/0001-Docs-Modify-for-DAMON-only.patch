 The Linux Kernel documentation
 ==============================
 
-This is the top level of the kernel's documentation tree.  Kernel
-documentation, like the kernel itself, is very much a work in progress;
-that is especially true as we work to integrate our many scattered
-documents into a coherent whole.  Please note that improvements to the
-documentation are welcome; join the linux-doc list at vger.kernel.org if
-you want to help out.
-
-Licensing documentation
------------------------
-
-The following describes the license of the Linux kernel source code
-(GPLv2), how to properly mark the license of individual files in the source
-tree, as well as links to the full license text.

-Introduction to kernel development
-----------------------------------
-
-These manuals contain overall information about how to develop the kernel.
-The kernel community is quite large, with thousands of developers
-contributing over the course of a year.  As with any large community,

 Kernel API documentation
 ------------------------
 
-These books get into the details of how specific kernel subsystems work

-is taken directly from the kernel source, with supplemental material added
-as needed (or at least as we managed to add it — probably *not* all that is
-needed).
