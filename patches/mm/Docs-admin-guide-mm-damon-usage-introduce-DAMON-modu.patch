Subject: [PATCH] Docs/admin-guide/mm/damon/usage: introduce DAMON modules at
 the beginning

DAMON usage document provides a list of available DAMON interfaces with
brief introduction at the beginning of the doc.  The list is missing DAMON
modules for special purposes, while it is one of the major suggested
interfaces.  Add an item for those to the list.
