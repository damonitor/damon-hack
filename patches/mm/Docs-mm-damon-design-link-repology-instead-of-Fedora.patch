Subject: [PATCH] Docs/mm/damon/design: link repology instead of Fedora package

The document is introducing Fedora as one way to get DAMON user-space tool
(damo) from OS-providing packaging system.  Linux distros more than Fedora
are providing damo with their packaging systems, though.  Replace the
Fedora part with the repology.org page that shows damo packaging status
for multiple Linux distros.
