Subject: [PATCH] mm/balloon_compaction: remove dependency on page lock
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Let's stop using the page lock in balloon code and instead use only the
balloon_device_lock.

As soon as we set the PG_movable_ops flag, we might now get isolation
callbacks for that page as we are no longer holding the page lock.  In
there, we'll simply synchronize using the balloon_device_lock.

So in balloon_page_isolate() lookup the balloon_dev_info through
page->private under balloon_device_lock.

It's crucial that we update page->private under the balloon_device_lock,
so the isolation callback can properly deal with concurrent deflation.

Consequently, make sure that balloon_page_finalize() is called under
balloon_device_lock as we remove a page from the list and clear
page->private.  balloon_page_insert() is already called with the
balloon_device_lock held.

Note that the core will still lock the pages, for example in
isolate_movable_ops_page().  The lock is there still relevant for handling
the PageMovableOpsIsolated flag, but that can be later changed to use an
atomic test-and-set instead, or moved into the movable_ops backends.

  * ensure following these simple rules:
  *
- *   i. Setting the PG_movable_ops flag and page->private with the following

- *	    +-page_lock(page);
- *	      +--spin_lock_irq(&balloon_pages_lock);
+ *   i. Inflation/deflation must set/clear page->private under the

  *
  *  ii. isolation or dequeueing procedure must remove the page from balloon
  *      device page list under balloon_pages_lock

- * The functions provided by this interface are placed to help on coping with
- * the aforementioned balloon page corner case, as well as to ensure the simple
- * set of exposed rules are satisfied while we are dealing with balloon pages
- * compaction / migration.
