Subject: [PATCH] mm/kconfig: make BALLOON_COMPACTION depend on MIGRATION
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Migration support for balloon memory depends on MIGRATION not COMPACTION.
Compaction is simply another user of page migration.

The last dependency on compaction.c was effectively removed with commit
3d388584d599 ("mm: convert "movable" flag in page->mapping to a page
flag").  Ever since, everything for handling movable_ops page migration
resides in core migration code.

So let's change the dependency and adjust the description + help text.

We'll rename BALLOON_COMPACTION separately next.
