Subject: [PATCH] selftests/mm/charge_reserved_hugetlb.sh: add waits with
 timeout helper

The hugetlb cgroup usage wait loops in charge_reserved_hugetlb.sh were
unbounded and could hang forever if the expected cgroup file value never
appears (e.g.  due to write_to_hugetlbfs in Error mapping).

=== Error log ===

Introduce a small helper, wait_for_file_value(), and use it for:
  - waiting for reservation usage to drop to 0,
  - waiting for reservation usage to reach a given size,
  - waiting for fault usage to reach a given size.

This makes the waits consistent and adds a hard timeout (60 tries with 1s
sleep) so the test fails instead of stalling indefinitely.
