+The first command of the above example downloads and builds an artificial
+memory access generator program called ``masim``.  The second command asks DAMO
+to execute the artificial generator process start via the given command and
+make DAMON monitors the generator process.  The third command retrieves the
+current snapshot of the monitored access pattern of the process from DAMON and
+shows the pattern in a human readable format.

+Each line of the output shows which virtual address range (``addr [XX, XX)``)
+of the process is how frequently (``access XX %``) accessed for how long time
+(``age XX``).  For example, the fifth region of ~9 MiB size is being most
+frequently accessed for last 300 milliseconds.  Finally, the fourth command
+stops DAMON.
 
 Note that DAMON can monitor not only virtual address spaces but multiple types
 of address spaces including the physical address space.
