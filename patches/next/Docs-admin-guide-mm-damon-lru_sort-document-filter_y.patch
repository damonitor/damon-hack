+LRU [de]prioritization operation.  LRU prioritization operation is skipped
+if the page has not accessed since the last check (not young).  LRU
+deprioritization operation is skipped if the page has accessed since the
+last check (young).  The feature is enabled or disabled if this parameter is
+set as ``Y`` or ``N``, respectively.
