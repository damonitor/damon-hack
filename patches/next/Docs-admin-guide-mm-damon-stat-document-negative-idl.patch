 DAMON_STAT calculates how long each byte of the memory was not accessed until
-now (idle time), based on the current DAMON results snapshot.  If DAMON found a
-region of access frequency (nr_accesses) larger than zero, every byte of the
-region gets zero idle time.  If a region has zero access frequency
-(nr_accesses), how long the region was keeping the zero access frequency (age)

+now (idle time), based on the current DAMON results snapshot.  For regions
+having access frequency (nr_accesses) larger than zero, how long the current
+access frequency level was kept multiplied by ``-1`` becomes the idlee time of
+every byte of the region.  If a region has zero access frequency (nr_accesses),
+how long the region was keeping the zero access frequency (age) becomes the
+idle time of every byte of the region.  Then, DAMON_STAT exposes the
+percentiles of the idle time values via this read-only parameter.  Reading the
+parameter returns 101 idle time values in milliseconds, separated by comma.
 Each value represents 0-th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ..., 99th and 100th percentile idle
 times.
