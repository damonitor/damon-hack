+---------------------------------------------
+
+This directory is for control of the :ref:`access sampling results filters
+<damon_design_sampling_results_filters>`.  At the beginning, this directory has
+only one file, ``nr_filters``.  Writing a positive integer ``<n>`` to the file
+generates directories of the number, named ``0`` to ``<n - 1>``.  The generated
+directories represent the sampling result filters to install to the DAMON
+context, in the order of the directory names.  Writing ``0`` to ``nr_filters``
+removes the directories.
+
+Under the individual filter directory, five files, ``type``, ``matching``,
+``allow``, ``cpumask`` and ``tid_arr`` exist.  The first three files are same
+to the properties of the filter specified on the :ref:`design doc
+<damon_design_sampling_results_filters>`.
+
+Users can specify the cpumask and thread id array of the filter by writing
+those to ``cpumask`` and ``tid_arr``.  The format for ``cpumask`` input is same
+to that for other cpumask inputs like that for cgroup cpusets.  For
+``tid_arr``, users can write array of the thread ids, separated by a comma.
