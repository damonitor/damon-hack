Subject: [PATCH] Docs/admin-guide/mm/damon/usage: update stats update process
 for refresh_ms

DAMOS stats on sysfs was only manually updated.  Recent addition of
'refresh_ms' knob enabled periodic and automated updates of the stats.
The document for stats update process is not updated for the change,
however.  Update.
