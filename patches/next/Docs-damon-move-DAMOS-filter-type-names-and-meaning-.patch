Subject: [PATCH] Docs/damon: move DAMOS filter type names and meaning to
 design doc

DAMON sysfs usage doc is describing DAMOS filter type names and their
meanings in short.  The design doc is providing the short meaning and
detailed descriptions.  Reduce usage document by moving names to design
doc, and adding a link to design doc on the usage section.

 Each filter directory contains nine files, namely ``type``, ``matching``,
 ``allow``, ``memcg_path``, ``addr_start``, ``addr_end``, ``min``, ``max``
-and ``target_idx``.  To ``type`` file, you can write one of six special
-keywords: ``anon`` for anonymous pages, ``memcg`` for specific memory cgroup,
-``young`` for young pages, ``addr`` for specific address range (an open-ended
-interval), ``hugepage_size`` for large folios of a specific size range [``min``,
-``max``] or ``target`` for specific DAMON monitoring target filtering.  Meaning
