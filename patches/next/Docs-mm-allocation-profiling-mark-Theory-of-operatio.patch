Subject: [PATCH] Docs/mm/allocation-profiling: mark 'Theory of operation' as
 chapter

'Theory of operation' part of allocation-profiling document is a
chapter.  However, it is mistakenly marked as document title.  As a
result, rendered mm document index page shows two items for the
document.  Fix it to be marked as a chapter.
