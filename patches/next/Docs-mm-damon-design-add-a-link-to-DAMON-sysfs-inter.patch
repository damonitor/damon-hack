Subject: [PATCH] Docs/mm/damon/design: add a link to DAMON sysfs interface
 usage doc

Readers of the design document's 'execution model and data structures'
would wonder how they can configure and start/stop DAMON from the
user-space.  The answer is DAMON sysfs interface.  Add a link to the
DAMON sysfs interface usage document on the design doc for easier
browsing.
