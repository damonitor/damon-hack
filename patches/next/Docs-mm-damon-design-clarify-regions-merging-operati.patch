Subject: [PATCH] Docs/mm/damon/design: clarify regions merging operation

DAMON design document is not explaining how min_nr_regions limit is
kept, and what happens if the number of regions exceeds max_nr_regions.
Add more clarification for those.

 monitoring quality.  To keep the assumption as much as possible, DAMON
 adaptively merges and splits each region based on their access frequency.

 In this way, DAMON provides its best-effort quality and minimal overhead while
 keeping the bounds users set for their trade-off.
