Subject: [PATCH] Docs/mm/damon/design: document DAMOS regions walking

DAMOS' regions walking is a feature for efficiently retrieving monitoring
results or DAMOS-internal behavior.  It can be useful for multiple
purposes including investigations and tuning.  Add a section for it on the
design document.
