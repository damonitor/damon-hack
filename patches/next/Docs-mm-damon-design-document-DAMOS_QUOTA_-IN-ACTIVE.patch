Subject: [PATCH] Docs/mm/damon/design: document DAMOS_QUOTA_[IN]ACTIVE_MEM_BP

Update design document for newly added DAMOS_QUOTA_[IN]ACTIVE_MEM_BP
metrics.  Note that API document is automatically updated by kernel-doc
comment, and the usage document points to the design document which uses
keywords same to that for sysfs inputs.  Hence updating only design
document is sufficient.
