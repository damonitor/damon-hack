+Access Sampling Results Filter
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Depending on the access sampling primitives that used, the sampling results
+could inform more than whether an access is made, such as the CPU or the thread
+the sampled access was made from, and whether the sampled access was for
+writing or reading.  By filtering the results based on the additional
+information, DAMON can perform for more detailed access monitoring, such as
+per-CPUs/threads or read/write-only monitoring.
+
+For such special types of monitoring, DAMON provides a feature called "sampling
+results filter".  The feature allows users to set an arbitrary number of
+filters for the sampling results.  Each of the filters specifies
+
+- a type of the additional information (``type``),
+- whether it is for the sampling results of the type or all except the type
+  (``matching``), and
+- whether it is to allow (include) or reject (exclude) consuming of the type of
+  sampling results.
+
+Each filter is applied in the order of the installation.  Only sampling results
+that allowed by previous filters are continue to be evaluated by the next
+filters.  If a sampling result is decided to be rejected by a filter, it is
+just discarded and no later filter is applied.
+
+Below ``type`` of access sampling results filter are currently supported.
+
+- cpumask
+    - Whether the sampled access was generated by a cpu that included in a
+      given cpumask.
+- threads
+    - Whether the sampled access was generated by a thread that having a thread
+      (task) id that exist in a given array of ids.
+- write
+    - Whether the sampled access was for writing.
