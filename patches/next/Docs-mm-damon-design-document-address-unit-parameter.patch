+Address Unit
+------------
+
+DAMON core layer uses ``unsinged long`` type for monitoring target address
+ranges.  In some cases, the address space for a given operations set could be
+too large to be handled with the type.  ARM (32-bit) with large physical
+address extension is an example.  For such cases, a per-operations set
+parameter called ``address unit`` is provided.  It represents the scale factor
+that need to be multiplied to the core layer's address for calculating real
+address on the given address space.  Support of ``address unit`` parameter is
+up to each operations set implementation.  ``paddr`` is the only operations set
+implementation that supports the parameter.
