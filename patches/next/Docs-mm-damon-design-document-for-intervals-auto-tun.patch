+Monitoring Intervals Auto-tuning
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+DAMON provides automatic tuning of the ``sampling interval`` and ``aggregation
+interval`` based on the :ref:`the tuning guide idea
+<damon_design_monitoring_params_tuning_guide>`.  The tuning mechanism allows
+users to set the aimed amount of heats to observe with DAMON within given time
+interval.  The target can be specified by the user as a ratio of access check
+samples that gave positive result to the total samples (``samples_bp``) that
+measured within a given number of aggregations (``aggrs``).  The mechanism
+calculates the ratio of access check samples for ``aggrs`` aggregations, and
+increases or decrease the ``sampleing interval`` and ``aggregation interval``
+in same ratio, if the samples ratio is lower or higher than the target,
+respectively.  The ratio of the intervals change is decided in proportion to
+the distance between current samples ratio and the target ratio.
+
+The user can further set the minimum and maximum ``sampling interval`` that can
+be set by the tuning mechanism using two parameters (``min_sample_us`` and
+``max_sample_us``).  Because the tuning mechanism changes ``sampling interval``
+and ``aggregation interval`` in same ratio always, the minimum and maximum
+``aggregation interval`` after each of the tuning changes can automatically set
+together.
+
+The tuning is turned off by default, and need to be set explicitly by the user.
+As a rule of thumbs and the Parreto principle, 20% access samples ratio target
+is recommended.
