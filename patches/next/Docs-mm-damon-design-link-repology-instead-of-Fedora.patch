Subject: [PATCH] Docs/mm/damon/design: link repology instead of Fedora package

The document is introducing Fedora as one way to get DAMON user-space
tool (damo) from OS-providing packaging system.  Linux distros more than
Fedora are providing damo with their packaging systems, though.  Replace
the Fedora part with the repology.org page that shows damo packaging
status for multiple Linux distros.
