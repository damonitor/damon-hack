 Operations Set Layer

+For data access monitoring and additional low level work, DAMON needs a set of

 1. Identification of the monitoring target address range for the address space.
 2. Access check of specific address range in the target space.

 DAMON currently provides below three operation sets.  Below two subsections
 describe how those work.
