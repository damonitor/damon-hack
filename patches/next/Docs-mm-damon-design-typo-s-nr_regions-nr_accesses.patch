Subject: [PATCH] Docs/mm/damon/design: typo: s/nr_regions/nr_accesses

'Region Based Sampling' section of DAMON design doc is mistakenly saying
the access frequency counter of region is called 'nr_regions'.  It is
definitely wrong.  The correct name is 'nr_accesses'.  Fix it.

 interval``, DAMON randomly picks one page in each region, waits for one
 ``sampling interval``, checks whether the page is accessed meanwhile, and
 increases the access frequency counter of the region if so.  The counter is

+called ``nr_accesses`` of the region.  Therefore, the monitoring overhead is
 controllable by setting the number of regions.  DAMON allows users to set the
 minimum and the maximum number of regions for the trade-off.
