+Access Sampling Primitives Selection
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Some operations set implementations could utilize multiple access sampling
+primitives.  For example, the operations set implementation for physical
+address space (``paddr``) support two promitives at the moment: 1) page tables'
+Accessed bits, and access monitoring-purpose page fault events.  In future, it
+could be extended for more hardware features such as AMD IBS or CXL HMU, and
+support from the operations set implementation for virtual address spaces
+(``vaddr``).  DAMON API callers or ABI users can select what primitives to use.
+
+At the moment, only exclusive use of the primitives is supported.
