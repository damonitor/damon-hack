 For data access monitoring and additional low level work, DAMON needs a set of
 implementations for specific operations that are dependent on and optimized for
-the given target address space.  For example, below two parts that essential
-for access monitoring are address-space dependent.
+the given target address space.  For example, below two operations for access
+monitoring are address-space dependent.
 
 1. Identification of the monitoring target address range for the address space.
 2. Access check of specific address range in the target space.
 
-On the other hand, the accuracy and overhead tradeoff mechanism, which is the
-core logic of DAMON, is in the pure logic space.  DAMON separates the two parts
-in different layers, namely DAMON Operations Set and DAMON Core Logics Layers,
-respectively.  It further defines the interface between the layers to allow
-various operations sets to be configured with the core logic.
+DAMON consolidates these implementations in a layer called DAMON Operations
+Set, and defines the interface between it and the upper layer.  The upper layer
+is dedicated for DAMON's core logics including the mechanism for control of the
+monitoring accruracy and the overhead.
 
-Due to this design, users can extend DAMON for any address space by configuring
-the core logic to use the appropriate operations set.  If any appropriate set
-is unavailable, users can implement one on their own.
+Hence, DAMON can easily be extended for any address space and/or available
+hardware features by configuring the core logic to use the appropriate
+operations set.  If there is no available operations set for a given purpose, a
+new operations set can be implemented following the interface between the
+layers.
 
 For example, physical memory, virtual memory, swap space, those for specific
 processes, NUMA nodes, files, and backing memory devices would be supportable.
-Also, if some architectures or devices supporting special optimized access
-check primitives, those will be easily configurable.

 DAMON currently provides below three operation sets.  Below two subsections
 describe how those work.
