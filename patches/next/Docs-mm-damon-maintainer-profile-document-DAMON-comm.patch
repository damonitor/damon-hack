+Community meetup
+----------------
+
+There are two bi-weekly meetup series for DAMON community.
+
+The first one is for any discussion between every community member.  No
+reservation is needed.
+
+The seconds one is for discussions on specific topics between restricted
+members including the maintainer.  Reservation is required to join the meeting.
+The maintainer shares the reservation available time slots, and attendees
+should reserve one of those at least 24 hours before the time slot, by reaching
+out to the maintainer.
+
+Schedules and available reservation time slots are available at the Google doc
