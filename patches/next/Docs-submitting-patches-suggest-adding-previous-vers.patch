Subject: [PATCH] Docs: submitting-patches: suggest adding previous version
 links

For pre-merge and post-merge review of patches that revisioned multiple
times, patch changelogs are very useful.  Adding actual links to the
previous versions can further help double checking if the changelog is
true, and finding more discussions made before.  Implicitly suggest
adding such links if available.
