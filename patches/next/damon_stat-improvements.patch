mm/damon/stat: expose auto-tuned intervals and non-idle ages

DAMON_STAT is intentionally providing limited information for easy
consumption.  From production fleet level usages, below limitations are
found, though.

The aggregation interval of DAMON_STAT represents the granularity of the
memory_idle_ms_percentiles.  But it is auto-tuned and not exposed to
users, so users cannot know the granularity.

All memory regions of non-zero (positive) nr_accesses are treated as
having zero idle time.  A significant portion of production systems have
such zero idle time.  Hence breakdown of warm and hot data is
impossible.

To overcome the limitations, expose the auto-tuned aggregation interval
with a new parameter named aggr_interval_us and the age of non-zero
nr_accesses regions as negative idle time, via the existing idle time
percentiles parameter.
