mm/damon: misc fixups and improvements for 6.18

Misc fixes and improvements for DAMON that are not critical and
therefore aims to be merged into Linux 6.18-rc1.

The first patch improves DAMON's age counting for nr_accesses zero
to/from non-zero changes.

The second patch fixes an initial DAMOS apply interval delay issue that
is not realistic but still could happen on an odd setup.

description and DAMON user-space tool example command for DAMOS usage,
respectively.

Finally, the fifth patch updates MAINTAINERS section name for DAMON to
just DAMON.
