Subject: [PATCH] mm/damon/core: destroy targets when kdamond_fn() finish

When kdamond_fn() completes, the targets are kept.  Those are kept to
let callers do additional cleanups if they need.  There are no such
additional cleanups though.  DAMON sysfs interface deallocates those in
before_terminate() callback, to reduce unnecessary memory usage, for
[f]vaddr use case.  Just destroy the targets for every case in the core
layer.  This saves more memory and simplifies the logic.
