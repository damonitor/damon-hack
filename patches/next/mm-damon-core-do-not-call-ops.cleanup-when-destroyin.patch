Subject: [PATCH] mm/damon/core: do not call ops.cleanup() when destroying
 targets

damon_operations.cleanup() is documented to be called for kdamond
termination, but also being called for targets destruction, which is
done for any damon_ctx destruction.  Nobody is using the callback for
now, though.  Remove cleanup() call under targets destruction.
