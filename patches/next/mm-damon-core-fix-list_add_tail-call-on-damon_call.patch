Subject: [PATCH] mm/damon/core: fix list_add_tail() call on damon_call()

Each damon_ctx maintains callback requests using a linked list
(damon_ctx->call_controls).  When a new callback request is received via
damon_call(), the new request should be added to the list.  However, the
function is making a mistake at list_add_tail() invocation: putting the
new item to add and the list head to add it before, in the opposite
order.  Because of the linked list manipulation implementation, the new
request can still be reached from the context's list head.  But the list
items that were added before the new request are dropped from the list.

As a result, the callbacks are unexpectedly not invocated.  Worse yet,
if the dropped callback requests were dynamically allocated, the memory
is leaked.  Actually DAMON sysfs interface is using a dynamically
allocated repeat-mode callback request for automatic essential stats
update.  And because the online DAMON parameters commit is using
a non-repeat-mode callback request, the issue can easily be reproduced,
like below.

    # damo start --damos_action stat --refresh_stat 1s
    # damo tune --damos_action stat --refresh_stat 1s

The first command dynamically allocates the repeat-mode callback request
for automatic essential stat update.  Users can see the essential stats
are automatically updated for every second, using the sysfs interface.

The second command calls damon_commit() with a new callback request that
was made for the commit.  As a result, the previously added repeat-mode
callback request is dropped from the list.  The automatic stats refresh
stops working, and the memory for the repeat-mode callback request is
leaked.  It can be confirmed using kmemleak.

Fix the mistake on the list_add_tail() call.
