Subject: [PATCH] mm/damon/core: remove call_control in inactive contexts

If damon_call() is executed against a DAMON context that is not running,
the function returns error while keeping the damon_call_control object
linked to the context's call_controls list.  Let's suppose the object is
deallocated after the damon_call(), and yet another damon_call() is
executed against the same context.  The function tries to add the new
damon_call_control object to the call_controls list, which still has the
pointer to the previous damon_call_control object, which is deallocated.
As a result, use-after-free happens.

This can actually be triggered using the DAMON sysfs interface.  It is
not easily exploitable since it requires the sysfs write permission and
making a definitely weird file writes, though.  Please refer to the
report for more details about the issue reproduction steps.

Fix the issue by making damon_call() to cleanup the damon_call_control
object before returning the error.
