Subject: [PATCH] mm/damon: fix divide by zero in damon_get_intervals_score()

The current implementation allows having zero size regions with no
special reasons, but damon_get_intervals_score() gets crashed by divide
by zero when the region size is zero.

  [   29.403950] Oops: divide error: 0000 [#1] SMP NOPTI

This patch fixes the bug, but does not disallow zero size regions to
keep the backward compatibility since disallowing zero size regions
might be a breaking change for some users.

In addition, the same crash can happen when intervals_goal.access_bp is
zero so this should be fixed in stable trees as well.
