Subject: [PATCH] mm/damon: introduce DAMOS_STAT_FULL

DAMOS_STAT is a special DAMOS action that does nothing but only stat
accounting.  It skips applying DAMON operations layer-handled DAMOS
filters, since it could induce some overheads, while there was no stat
to account with the filtering results.  Now there are per-scheme and
per-region filter-passed bytes stats.  Since DAMOS_STAT's behavior is
documented and some users may still need it, introduce a new monitoring
purpose action, namely DAMOS_STAT_FULL.
