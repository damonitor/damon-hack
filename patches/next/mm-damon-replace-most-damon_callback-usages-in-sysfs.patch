mm/damon: replace most damon_callback usages in sysfs with new core functions

DAMON provides damon_callback API that notifies monitoring events and
allows safe access to damon_ctx internal data.  The usage is simple.
Users register and deregister callback functions for different
monitoring events in damon_ctx.  Then the DAMON worker thread (kdamond)
of the damon_ctx calls back the registered functions on the events.

It is designed in such simple way because it was sufficient for usages
of DAMON at the early days.  We also wanted to make it flexible so that
API user code can implement any required additional features on top of
damon_callback on their demands.

As expected, more sophisticated usages have invented.  Online updates of
DAMON parameters and DAMOS auto-tuning inputs, and online retrieval of
DAMOS statistics and tried regions information are such usages.  Because
damon_callback doesn't provide any explicit synchronization mechanism,
the user ABIs for exposing such functionalities are implemented in
asynchronous ways (DAMON_RECLAIM and DAMON_LRU_SORT}), or synchronous
ways (DAMON_SYSFS) with additional synchronization mechanisms that built
inside the ABI implementation, on top of damon_callback.

So damon_callback is working as expected.  However, the additional
mechanisms built inside ABI on top of damon_callback is becoming
somewhat too big and not easy to maintain.  The additional mechanisms
can be smaller and easier to maintain when implemented inside the core
logic layer.

Introduce two new DAMON core API, namely 'damon_call()' and
'damos_walk()'.  The two functions support synchronous access to
- damon_ctx internal data including DAMON parameters and monitoring
  results, and
- DAMOS-specific data such as regions that each DAMOS action is applied,
respectively.

And replace most of damon_callback usages in DAMON sysfs interface with
the new core API functions.  damon_callback usage for online DAMON
parameters tuning is not replaced in this series, since it has specific
callback timing assumptions that require more works.

Patch sequence
==============

First two patches are fixups for simplifying the following changes.
Those remove a unnecessary condition check and a synchronization,
respectively.

Third patch implements one of the new DAMON core APIs, namely
damon_call().  Three patches replacing damon_callback usages in DAMON
sysfs interface using damon_call() follow.

Then, seventh and eighth patches introduces the other new DAMON API,
damos_walk(), and document it on the design doc.  Ninth patch replaces
two damon_callback usages in DAMON sysfs interface using damos_walk().

The tenth patch finally cleans up code that no more being used.
