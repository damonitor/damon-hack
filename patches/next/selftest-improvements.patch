selftests/damon: improve leak detection and wss estimation reliability

Two DAMON selftets, namely 'sysfs_memcg_leak' and
'sysfs_update_schemes_tried_regions_wss_estimation' frequently show
intermittent failures due to their unreliable leak detection and working
set size estimation.  Make those more reliable.
