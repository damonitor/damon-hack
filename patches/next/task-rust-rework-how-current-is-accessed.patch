Subject: [PATCH] task: rust: rework how current is accessed
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Introduce a new type called `CurrentTask` that lets you perform various
operations that are only safe on the `current` task.  Use the new type to
provide a way to access the current mm without incrementing its refcount.

With this change, you can write stuff such as

	let vma = current!().mm().lock_vma_under_rcu(addr);

without incrementing any refcounts.

This replaces the existing abstractions for accessing the current pid
namespace.  With the old approach, every field access to current involves
both a macro and a unsafe helper function.  The new approach simplifies
that to a single safe function on the `CurrentTask` type.  This makes it
less heavy-weight to add additional current accessors in the future.

That said, creating a `CurrentTask` type like the one in this patch
requires that we are careful to ensure that it cannot escape the current
task or otherwise access things after they are freed.  To do this, I
declared that it cannot escape the current "task context" where I defined
a "task context" as essentially the region in which `current` remains
unchanged.  So e.g., release_task() or begin_new_exec() would leave the
task context.

If a userspace thread returns to userspace and later makes another
syscall, then I consider the two syscalls to be different task contexts.
This allows values stored in that task to be modified between syscalls,
even if they're guaranteed to be immutable during a syscall.

Ensuring correctness of `CurrentTask` is slightly tricky if we also want
the ability to have a safe `kthread_use_mm()` implementation in Rust.  To
support that safely, there are two patterns we need to ensure are safe:

	// Case 1: current!() called inside the scope.
	let mm;
	kthread_use_mm(some_mm, || {
	    mm = current!().mm();
	});
	drop(some_mm);
	mm.do_something(); // UAF

and:

	// Case 2: current!() called before the scope.
	let mm;
	let task = current!();
	kthread_use_mm(some_mm, || {
	    mm = task.mm();
	});
	drop(some_mm);
	mm.do_something(); // UAF

The existing `current!()` abstraction already natively prevents the first
case: The `&CurrentTask` would be tied to the inner scope, so the
borrow-checker ensures that no reference derived from it can escape the
scope.

Fixing the second case is a bit more tricky.  The solution is to
essentially pretend that the contents of the scope execute on an different
thread, which means that only thread-safe types can cross the boundary.
Since `CurrentTask` is marked `NotThreadSafe`, attempts to move it to
another thread will fail, and this includes our fake pretend thread
boundary.

This has the disadvantage that other types that aren't thread-safe for
reasons unrelated to `current` also cannot be moved across the
`kthread_use_mm()` boundary.  I consider this an acceptable tradeoff.
