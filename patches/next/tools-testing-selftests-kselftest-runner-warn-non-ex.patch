Subject: [PATCH] tools/testing/selftests/kselftest/runner: warn non-executable
 tests only when really cannot execute

If a test program is not having the executable permission, runner.sh
warns the fact, and then checks if it has a shebang.  If the shebang is
not found, it simply fails.  Otherwise, it parses the interpreter and
execute the test with it.  The warning can be helpful in the former case
since it allows users know why it failed.  But in the latter case, it is
just a noise that users usually don't really care.  Print the message
only for the failing case.
