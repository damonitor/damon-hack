Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Docs/damon/maintaier-profile: document a mailing tool and community meetup series

There is a mailing tool that developed and maintained by DAMON
maintainer aiming to support DAMON community.  Also there are DAMON
community meetup series.  Both are known to have rooms of improvements
in terms of their visibility.  Document those on the maintainer's
profile document.
