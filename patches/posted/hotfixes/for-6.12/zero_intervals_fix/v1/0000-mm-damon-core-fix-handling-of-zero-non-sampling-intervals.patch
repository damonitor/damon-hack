Subject: [PATCH 0/2] mm/damon/core: fix handling of zero non-sampling intervals
Message-Id: <20241031183757.49610-1-sj@kernel.org>

DAMON's internal intervals accounting logic is not correctly handling
non-sampling intervals of zero values for a wrong assumption.  This
could cause unexpected monitoring behavior, and even result in infinite
hang of DAMON sysfs interface user threads in case of zero aggregation
interval.  Fix those by updating the intervals accounting logic.  For
details of the root case and solutions, please refer to commit messages
of fixes.
