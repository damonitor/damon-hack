Subject: [PATCH 0/3] mm/damon/core: fix wrong and/or useless damos_walk() behaviors

damos_walk() can finish working earlier or later than expected, and
start earlier than practical.  First two behaviors are clearly wrong
behavior (doesn't follow the documentation) and all three behaviors are
only making the feature useless.  Fix those.

SeongJae Park (3):
  mm/damon/core: unset damos->walk_completed after confimed set
  mm/damon/core: do not call damos_walk_control->walk() if walk is
    completed
  mm/damon/core: do damos walking in entire regions granularity
