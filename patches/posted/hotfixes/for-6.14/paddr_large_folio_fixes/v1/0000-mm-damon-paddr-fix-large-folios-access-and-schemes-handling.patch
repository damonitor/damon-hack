Subject: [PATCH 0/2] mm/damon/paddr: fix large folios access and schemes handling

DAMON operations set for physical address space, namely 'paddr', treats
tail pages as unaccessed always.  It can also apply DAMOS action to
a large folio multiple times within single DAMOS' regions walking.  As a
result, the monitoring output has poor quality and DAMOS works in
unexpected ways when large folios are being used.  Fix those.

The patches were parts of Usama's hugepage_size DAMOS filter patch
series[1].  The first fix has collected from there with a slight commit
message change for the subject prefix.  The second fix is re-written by
SJ and posted as an RFC before this series.  The second one also got a
slight commit message change for the subject prefix.
