Subject: [PATCH 0/2] fixup DAMOS_MIGRATE_{HOT,COLD} patchset documentation

DAMOS_MIGRATE_{HOT,COLD} documentation[1], which is currently merged in
the mm-unstable tree, has two trivial problems.

Firstly, the usage document.  It missed updating some parts of the
document, and the layout of some paragraphs could be more consistent.
Secondly, DAMON sysfs ABI document is not updated.  Fix the two trivial
problems with two patches, respectively.

Andrew, could you plaese squash the first patch for usage document fixup
into the original patch[1]?  Meanwhile, I'd prefer keeping the second
patch as separate one, since I prefer having individual commit to touch
single file if possible.
