Subject: [PATCH 5.15.y 0/8] Backport patches for DAMON merge regions fix

Commit 310d6c15e910 ("mm/damon/core: merge regions aggressively when
max_nr_regions") causes a build warning and a build failure [1] on
5.15.y.  Those are due to
1) unnecessarily strict type check from max(), and
2) use of not-yet-introduced damon_ctx->attrs field, respectively.

Fix the warning by backporting a minmax.h upstream commit that made the
type check less strict for unnecessary case, and upstream commits that
it depends on.

Note that all patches except the fourth one ("minmax: fix header
inclusions") are clean cherry-picks of upstream commit.  For the fourth
one, minor conflict resolving was needed.

Also, the last patch, which is the backport of the DAMON fix, was
cleanly cherry-picked, but added manual fix for the build failure.

Andy Shevchenko (1):
  minmax: fix header inclusions

Bart Van Assche (1):
  tracing: Define the is_signed_type() macro once

David Laight (3):
  minmax: allow min()/max()/clamp() if the arguments have the same
    signedness.
  minmax: allow comparisons of 'int' against 'unsigned char/short'
  minmax: relax check to allow comparison between unsigned arguments and
    signed constants

Jason A. Donenfeld (2):
  minmax: sanity check constant bounds when clamping
  minmax: clamp more efficiently by avoiding extra comparison

SeongJae Park (1):
  mm/damon/core: merge regions aggressively when max_nr_regions is unmet
