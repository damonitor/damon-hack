Subject: [PATCH 6.1.y 0/7] Backport patches for DAMON merge regions fix

Commit 310d6c15e910 ("mm/damon/core: merge regions aggressively when
max_nr_regions") causes a build warning [1] on 6.1.y.  That was due to
unnecessarily strict type check from max().

Fix the warning by backporting a minmax.h upstream commit that made the
type check less strict for unnecessary case, and upstream commits that
it depends on.

Note that all patches except the third one ("minmax: fix header
inclusions") are clean cherry-picks of upstream commit.  For the third
one, a minor conflict fix was needed.

Andy Shevchenko (1):
  minmax: fix header inclusions

David Laight (3):
  minmax: allow min()/max()/clamp() if the arguments have the same
    signedness.
  minmax: allow comparisons of 'int' against 'unsigned char/short'
  minmax: relax check to allow comparison between unsigned arguments and
    signed constants

Jason A. Donenfeld (2):
  minmax: sanity check constant bounds when clamping
  minmax: clamp more efficiently by avoiding extra comparison

SeongJae Park (1):
  mm/damon/core: merge regions aggressively when max_nr_regions is unmet
