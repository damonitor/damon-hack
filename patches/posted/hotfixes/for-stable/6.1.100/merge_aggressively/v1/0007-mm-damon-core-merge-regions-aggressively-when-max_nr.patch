Subject: [PATCH 6.1.y 7/7] mm/damon/core: merge regions aggressively when
 max_nr_regions is unmet

commit 310d6c15e9104c99d5d9d0ff8e5383a79da7d5e6 upstream.

DAMON keeps the number of regions under max_nr_regions by skipping regions
split operations when doing so can make the number higher than the limit.
It works well for preventing violation of the limit.  But, if somehow the
violation happens, it cannot recovery well depending on the situation.  In
detail, if the real number of regions having different access pattern is
higher than the limit, the mechanism cannot reduce the number below the
limit.  In such a case, the system could suffer from high monitoring
overhead of DAMON.

The violation can actually happen.  For an example, the user could reduce
max_nr_regions while DAMON is running, to be lower than the current number
of regions.  Fix the problem by repeating the merge operations with
increasing aggressiveness in kdamond_merge_regions() for the case, until
the limit is met.
