Organizing patches based on their aimed mainline merge target, or when it was
posted.

For example:

Patches in 'for-6.17-rc1' are the patches that developed and posted aiming to
be merged into 6.17-rc1.  Now we don't use this scheme anymore, since the
target could move.

Patches in 'on-6.18-cycle' are the patches that posted during 6.18
"stabilization" cycle (v6.18-rc1..v6.19).
