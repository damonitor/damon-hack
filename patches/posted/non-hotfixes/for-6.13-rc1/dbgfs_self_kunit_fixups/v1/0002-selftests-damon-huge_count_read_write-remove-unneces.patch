Subject: [PATCH 2/6] selftests/damon/huge_count_read_write: remove unnecessary
 debugging message

The program prints expected errors from write/read of the files with
invalid huge count, for only debugging purpose.  It is only making the
output noisy.  Remove those.

Fixes: b4a002889d24 ("selftests/damon: test debugfs file reads/writes with huge count")
