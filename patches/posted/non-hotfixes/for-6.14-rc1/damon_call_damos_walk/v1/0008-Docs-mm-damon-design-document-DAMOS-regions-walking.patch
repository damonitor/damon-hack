Subject: [PATCH 08/10] Docs/mm/damon/design: document DAMOS regions walking

DAMOS' regions walking is a feature for efficiently retrieving
monitoring results or DAMOS-internal behavior.  It can be useful for
multiple purposes including investigations and tuning.  Add a section
for it on the design document.
