Subject: [PATCH 0/7] mm/damon: remove DAMON debugfs interface

DAMON debugfs interface was the only user interface of DAMON at the
beginning[1].  However, it turned out the interface would be not good
enough for long-term flexibility and stability.

In Feb 2022[2], we therefore introduced DAMON sysfs interface as an
alternative user interface that aims long-term flexibility and
stability.  With its introduction, DAMON debugfs interface has announced
to be deprecated in near future.

In Feb 2023[3], we announced the official deprecation of DAMON debugfs
interface.  In Jan 2024[4], we further made the deprecation difficult to
be ignored.

In Oct 2024[5], we posted an RFC version of this patch series as the
last notice.

And as of this writing, no problem or concerns about the removal plan
have reported.  Apparently users are already moved to the alternative,
or made good plans for the change.

Remove the DAMON debugfs interface code from the tree.  Given the past
timeline and the absence of reported problems or concerns, it is safe
enough to be done.
