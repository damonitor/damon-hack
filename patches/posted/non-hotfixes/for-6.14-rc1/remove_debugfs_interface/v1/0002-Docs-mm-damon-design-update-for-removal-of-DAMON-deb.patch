Subject: [PATCH 2/7] Docs/mm/damon/design: update for removal of DAMON debugfs
         interface

It's time to remove DAMON debugfs interface, which has deprecated long
before in February 2023.  Read the cover letter of this patch series for
more details.

Update DAMON design documentation to stop mentioning about the
interface, to avoid unnecessary confuses.
