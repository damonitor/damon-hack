Subject: [PATCH 0/9] mm/damon: make allow filters after reject filters useful and intuitive

DAMOS filters do allow or reject elements of memory for given DAMOS
scheme only if those match the filter criterias.  For elements that
don't match any DAMOS filter, 'allowing' is the default behavior.  This
makes allow-filters that don't have any reject-filter after them
meaningless sources of overhead.  The decision was made to keep the
behavior consistent with that before the introduction of allow-filters.
This, however, makes usage of DAMOS filters confusing and inefficient.
It is more intuitive and still consistent behavior to reject by default
unless there is no filter at all or the last filter is a reject filter.
Update the filtering logic in the way and update documents to clarify
the behavior.

Note that this is changing the old behavior.  But the old behavior for
the problematic filter combination was definitely confusing, inefficient
and anyway useless.  Also, the behavior has relatively recently
introduced.  It is difficult to anticipate any user that depends on the
behavior.  Hence this is not a user-breaking behavior change but an
obvious improvement.
