Subject: [PATCH 0/8] mm/damon: add sysfs dirs for managing DAMOS filters based on handling layers

DAMOS filters are categorized into two groups based on their handling
layers, namely core and operations layers.  The categorization affects
when each filter is evaluated.  Core layer handled filters are evaluated
first.  The order meant nothing before, but introduction of allow
filters changed that.

DAMOS sysfs interface provides single directory for filters, namely
'filters'.  Users can install any filters in any order there.  DAMON
will internally categorize those into core and operations layer handled
ones, and apply the evaluation order rule.  The ordering rule is clearly
documented.  But the interface could still confuse users since it is
allowed to install filters on the directory in mixed ways.

Add two sysfs directories for managing filters by handling layers,
namely 'core_filters' and 'ops_filters' for filters that handled by core
and operations layer, respectively.  Those are avoided to be used for
installing filters that not handled by the assumed layers.

For backward compatibility, keep 'filters' directory with its curernt
behavior.  Filters installed in the directory will be added to DAMON
after those of 'core_filters' and 'ops_filters' directories, with the
automatic categorizations.  Also recommend users to use the new
directories while noticing 'filters' directory could be deprecated in
future on the usage documents.

Note that new directories provide all features that were provided with
'filters', but just in a more clear way.  Deprecating 'filters' in
future will hence not make an irreversal feature loss.
