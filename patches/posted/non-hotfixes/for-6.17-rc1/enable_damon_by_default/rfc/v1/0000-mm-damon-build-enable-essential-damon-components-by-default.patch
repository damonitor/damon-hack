Subject: [RFC PATCH 0/2] mm/damon: build-enable essential DAMON components by default

As of this writing, a few major distros including Alma, Amazon, Android,
CentOS, Debian, Fedora, and Oracle are build-enabling DAMON (set
CONFIG_DAMON[1]).  Configuring DAMON is not very easy, since it is
disabled by default, and there are multiple essential options that need
to be manually turned on, one by one.  Make it easier, by grouping
essential configurations to be enabled with one selection, and enabling
build of the essential parts of DAMON by default.

Note that build-enabling DAMON does not introduce a real risk, since it
makes no behavioral change by default.  It requires users to make
explicit requests to do something.  Only one potential risk is making
the size of the kernel a little bit larger.  On a configuration, it
increases the resulting kernel package binary size by 337,685 bytes,
which is about 0.1 % of the final package file.
