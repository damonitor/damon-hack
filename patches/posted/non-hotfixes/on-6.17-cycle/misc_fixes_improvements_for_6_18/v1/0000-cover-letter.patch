Subject: [PATCH 0/6] mm/damon: misc fixups and improvements for 6.18

Misc fixes and improvements for DAMON that are not critical and
therefore aims to be merged into Linux 6.18-rc1.

The first patch improves DAMON's age counting for nr_accesses zero
to/from non-zero changes.

The second patch fixes an initial DAMOS apply interval delay issue that
is not realistic but still could happen on an odd setup.

The third patch fixes wrongly written code that doesn't cause any real
problem but could make code review confusing.

The fourth and the fifth patches update DAMON community meetup
description and DAMON user-space tool example command for DAMOS usage,
respectively.

Finally, the sixth patch updates MAINTAINERS section name for DAMON to
just DAMON.

- The RFC was only for the first patch
