Subject: [PATCH 4/6] Docs/mm/damon/maintainer-profile: update community meetup for reservation requirements

DAMON community meetup was having two different kinds of meetups:
reservation required ones and unrequired ones.  Now the reservation
unrequested one is gone, but the documentation on the maintainer-profile
is not updated.  Update.
