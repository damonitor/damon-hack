Subject: [PATCH 8/8] Docs/admin-guide/mm/damon/stat: document negative idle time

Commit a983a26d5298 ("mm/damon/stat: expose negative idle time")
introduced the negative idle time feature for DAMON_STAT.  But it is not
documented.  Document it on the usage document.

 DAMON_STAT calculates how long each byte of the memory was not accessed until
-now (idle time), based on the current DAMON results snapshot.  If DAMON found a
-region of access frequency (nr_accesses) larger than zero, every byte of the
-region gets zero idle time.  If a region has zero access frequency
-(nr_accesses), how long the region was keeping the zero access frequency (age)

 Each value represents 0-th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ..., 99th and 100th percentile idle
 times.
