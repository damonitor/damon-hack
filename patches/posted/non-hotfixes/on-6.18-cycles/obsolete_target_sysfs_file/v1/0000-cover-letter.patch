Subject: [PATCH 0/9] mm/damon: support pin-point targets removal

DAMON maintains the targets in a list, and allows committing only an
entire list of targets having the new parameters.  Targets having same
index on the lists are treated as matching source and destination
targets.  If an existing target cannot find a matching one in the
sources list, the target is removed.  This means that there is no way to
remove only a specific monitoring target in the middle of the current
targets list.

Such pin-point target removal is really needed in some use cases,
though.  Monitoring access patterns on virtual address spaces of
processes that spawned from the same ancestor is one example.  If a
process of the group is terminated, the user may want to remove the
matching DAMON target as soon as possible, to save in-kernel memory
usage for the unnecessary target data.  The user may also want to do
that without turning DAMON off or removing unnecessary targets, to keep
the current monitoring results for other active processes.

Extend DAMON kernel API and sysfs ABI to support the pin-point removal
in the following way.  For API, add a new damon_target field, namely
'obsolete'.  If the field on parameters commit source target is set, it
means the matching destination target is obsolete.  Then the parameters
commit logic removes the destination target from the existing targets
list.  For sysfs ABI, add a new file under the target directory, namely
'obsolete_target'.  It is connected with the 'obsolete' field of the
commit source targets, so internally using the new API.

Also add a selftest for the new feature.  The related helper scripts for
manipulating the sysfs interface and dumping in-kernel DAMON status are
also extended for this.  Note that the selftest part was initially
posted as an individual RFC series [1], but now merged into this one.

Bijan Tabatabai (bijan311@gmail.com) has originally reported this issue,
and participated in this solution design on a GitHub issue [1] for DAMON
user-space tool.
