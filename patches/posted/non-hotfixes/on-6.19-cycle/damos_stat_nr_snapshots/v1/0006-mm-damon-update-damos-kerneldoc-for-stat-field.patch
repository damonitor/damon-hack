Subject: [PATCH 06/12] mm/damon: update damos kerneldoc for stat field

Commit 0e92c2ee9f45 ("mm/damon/schemes: account scheme actions that
successfully applied") has replaced ->stat_count and ->stat_sz of
'struct damos' with ->stat.  The commit mistakenly did not update the
related kernel doc comment, though.  Update the comment.
