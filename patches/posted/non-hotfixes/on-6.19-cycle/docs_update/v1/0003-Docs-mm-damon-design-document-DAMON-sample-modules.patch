Subject: [PATCH 3/8] Docs/mm/damon/design: document DAMON sample modules

People sometimes get confused about the purposes of DAMON
special-purpose modules and sample modules.  Clarify those on the design
document by adding a section describing their existence and purposes.

+Sample DAMON Modules
+--------------------

+DAMON modules that provides example DAMON kernel API usages.
+
+kernel programmers can build their own special or general purpose DAMON modules

+used on real products, but only for showing how DAMON kernel API can be used in
+simple ways.
