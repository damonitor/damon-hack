Subject: [PATCH 8/8] Docs/mm/damon/maintainer-profile: remove damon-tests/perf
         suggestion

The DAMON performance tests [1] use PARSEC 3.0 as its major test
workloads.  But the official web site for PARSEC 3.0 has gone, so there
is no easy way to get the benchmark.  Mainly due to the fact, DAMON
performance tests are difficult to run, and effectively broken.  Do not
request running it for now.  Instead, suggest running any benchmarks or
real world workloads that make sense for performance changes.
