Subject: [RFC PATCH v3 35/37] mm/damon/core: support write access sample filter

Now page fault events based access reports contain information about if
the access was for a read or a write.  Doing sampling results filtering
based on the information can be useful.  Introduce a new type of damon
sample filter for that.
