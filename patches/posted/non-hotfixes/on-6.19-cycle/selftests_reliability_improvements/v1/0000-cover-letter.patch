Subject: [PATCH 0/5] selftests/damon: improve leak detection and wss estimation reliability

Two DAMON selftets, namely 'sysfs_memcg_leak' and
'sysfs_update_schemes_tried_regions_wss_estimation' frequently show
intermittent failures due to their unreliable leak detection and working
set size estimation.  Make those more reliable.

SeongJae Park (5):
  selftests/damon/sysfs_memcg_path_leak.sh: use kmemleak
  selftests/damon/wss_estimation: test for up to 160 MiB working set
    size
  selftests/damon/access_memory: add repeat mode
  selftests/damon/wss_estimation: ensure number of collected wss
  selftests/damon/wss_estimation: deduplicate failed samples output
