Subject: Looking back DAMON development in 2022

Hello,


The last major Linux version of 2021, v5.15, was the deview of DAMON.  After
the release, one more thankful year of DAMON development has passed.  I'd like
to share some major events and statistics of DAMON development that we had in
2022, and say thank you to the community.

Summary
=======

2022 was an year of active and healthy DAMON development.

Seven new DAMON major features have delivered to users.  Some of those were
featured by articles and academic papers.

It was possible because of DAMON community.  The community has expanded with
its own mailing list and open bi-weekly chat series.  40 people contributed
their great code to DAMON via making their 275 commits merged into the
mainline.  About 33% of the commits were made by Amazon-external contributors.

The amount of DAMON changes in 2022 (v5.15..v6.2-rc1) was not that tiny
compared to other subsystems.  About 0.2% of the commits for whole Linux tree
was for DAMON.  Among the changes for DAMON's parent subsystem, mm, about 8% of
commits and 14% of lines of changes were made for DAMON.

Key Events
==========

In January of 2022, v5.16, the first major Linux version of 2022, has release
with major DAMON features including
 - DAMON-based Operation Schemes,
 - Physical address space monitoring support,
 - DAMOS quota/priorities/watermarks, and
 - Data Access-aware Reclaim module (DAMON_RECLAIM).

In April, DAMON and DAMON_RECLAIM have merged[1] into Android.

In May, v5.18 has released with DAMON sysfs interface, which is aimed to be the
flexible and stable DAMON interface for long term usage.  We also made a
mailing list which is dedicated for DAMON development (damon@lists.linux.dev).

In June, we presented DAMON-related works in an academic conference, HPDC[2].

In July, v5.19 has released with DAMON online tuning feature.  This opened the
chance for more optimal and automated tuning of DAMON.  DAMON has also
featured[3] on Embedded Linux Conference'22 keynote.

In August, DAMON community started its bi-weekly virtual open chat series[4].
DAMON-based Proactive LRU-lists Sorting patchset, which reduces about 20% of
pressure stall time, has merged into the mainline and featured by LWN[5].

In September, DAMON's current status and future plans have presented[6] at
KernelSummit.

In October, v6.0 has released with DAMON-based Proactive LRU lists sorting.  We
also had a first in-person DAMON community meetup[7] in LPC.

In November and December, DAMOS tried regions patchset, which makes query-like
efficient monitoring results collection available, and DAMOS filters patchset,
which allows finer tuning and cgroups support of DAMON-based memory
managements, have developed.  The first one has merged in v6.2-rc1 in December.
The second one will hopefully be merged into v6.3 in 2023.

Development Statistics
======================

To appreciate to and list all names of people who made DAMON available, and to
quantify what 2022 was for DAMON development, I collected some numbers using my
humble and buggy scripts.  The scripts are available as open source[1,2].

Please note that there were many more unsung hero contributors that contributed
valuable inputs, discussions, and many more things for DAMON development.  So
shame that I cannot put everyone's name here.

Thank you so much to all awesome contributors!

Contributions from non-maintainer
---------------------------------

The maintainer, SJ (sj@kernel.org), has driven the development of DAMON, but
the helps from the community was huge.  About 33% of DAMON commits have made by
people other than the maintainer.

$ ./damon_hack/stat_damon_portion_community_commits.sh ./linux
range               from_sj non_sj    non_sj_portion
v5.15..v5.16        50      13        20.63%
v5.16..v5.17        16      10        38.46%
v5.17..v5.18        26      10        27.78%
v5.18..v5.19        23      7         23.33%
v5.19..v6.0         15      14        48.28%
v6.0..v6.1          33      36        52.17%
v6.1..linus/master  28      6         17.65%
v5.15..linus/master 191     95        33.22%

Portion of DAMON Commits in MM and Linux
----------------------------------------

To show how much change DAMON made to its parent subsystem, MM, and whole
Linux, I counted number of commits that touched mm/damon, mm/ and any file of
the Linux tree in 2022 releases (v5.15..v6.2-rc1).  Note that I counted changes
touching only mm/damon/ and mm/ for DAMON and MM appropriately (doesn't count
changes for documents, headers, tests, etc), for simplicity.

According to the buggy and humble script, about 8% of MM commits, and 0.2% of
Linux commits were made for DAMON.

$ ./damon_hack/stat_damon_portion_nr_commits.sh ./linux
range               damon mm   damon/mm linux  damon/linux
v5.15..v5.16        45    307  14.66%   14190  0.32%
v5.16..v5.17        17    223  7.62%    13038  0.13%
v5.17..v5.18        29    448  6.47%    14954  0.19%
v5.18..v5.19        24    399  6.02%    15134  0.16%
v5.19..v6.0         15    283  5.30%    15402  0.10%
v6.0..v6.1          61    536  11.38%   13942  0.44%
v6.1..linus/master  20    250  8.00%    13687  0.15%
v5.15..linus/master 211   2446 8.63%    100347 0.21%

By Number of Lines
------------------

I further counted the portion of the number of changed lines.  Didn't count
that for Linux here due to the slow speed of the script.  Please also note tht
I count changes touching only mm/damon/ and mm/ as same to above case.  The
script argues about 14% of the changes lines for MM subsystem were for DAMON.

$ ./damon_hack/stat_damon_portion_lines.sh ./linux
range               damon mm    damon/mm
v5.15..v5.16        2157  8503  25.37%
v5.16..v5.17        324   9370  3.46%
v5.17..v5.18        3462  16288 21.25%
v5.18..v5.19        929   10185 9.12%
v5.19..v6.0         870   8665  10.04%
v6.0..v6.1          1752  25844 6.78%
v6.1..linus/master  3309  10544 31.38%
v5.15..linus/master 12803 89399 14.32%

Conclusion
==========

DAMON community delivered a number of important features and quite amount of
changes to the world via the collaboration between the 40 great contributors.
I would call 2022 as one of the greatest years of DAMON development.

Huge thanks to you again, DAMON community.  Looking forward to continue our
journey in 2023.

Hope you all to enjoy the remaining holidays and happy new year!


Thanks,
SJ
