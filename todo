Planning / Considering
----------------------

- add kunit test for all parameters commit functions
- per-noe memory bandwidth utilization DAMOS quota goal metric
- per-filtered-address-ragne prioritization
  - do the temperature-prioritization for address filter-passed regions,
    separately
- clarify possible monitoring results loss on usage doc.
- make DAMON_STAT cover multiple hot-[un]pluggable NUMA nodes
  - implement and use kind of three big regions detection mechanism
- implement addr_unit commit kunit test
- implement addr_unit to/from core address conversion kunit test
- handle charged_ns overflow on 32bit machines
- cleanup damon_set_attrs() documentation
- add kunit test for damon_call() and damos_walk()
- DAMON-based khugepaged
  - Make khugepaged listen DAMON's voice when collapsing
- Support multi contexts per kdamond
- Add sharable kdamond
  - Run with auto-tuned intervals
  - Let API callers report access information, read monitoring results and
    add/remove DAMOS schemes
    - Major callers would be DAMON modules
    - damon_get_handle(), damon_report_access(), damos_add_folios()
  - Let ABI users read monitoring results and DAMOS stat
    - /sys/kernel/mm/damon/???/
- DAMON_NUMA_MIGRATE
  - Aim for not only traditional NUMA but also tiering
  - Just extend mtier to every node, but CPU-aware.
- sysfs command for updating params (for restoring old params)
- write a selftest for sz_filter_passed
- contigurized-vddr
  - trat end of a discrete region as start of next region
  - connect regions before and after huge unmapped area
  - connect regions of different virtual addresses
- Write API documentation
  - no just kerenl doc, but more structured document is needed
- Let users decide regions split factor
  - https://lore.kernel.org/20241026215311.148363-1-sj@kernel.org
- Let users periodically split regions without per-region subregions limit
  - https://lore.kernel.org/20241026215311.148363-1-sj@kernel.org
- Sampling based page level properties based monitoring
  - For DAMOS_STAT, do sampling for sz_filter_passed calculation
    - Let user sets the number of samples per region for this
- Support reserved uninstall of DAMOS
  - Allow running DAMOS scheme for only specific apply intervals
- Extend for memory bandwidth monitoring
- Extend for AMD IBS-based monitoring
- Extend for cache-set space monitoring
- Extend for cache-line space monitoring
  - Require sub-page level monitoring (IBS?)
- Access/Contiguity-aware Memory Auto-scaling
  - https://lore.kernel.org/damon/20240512193657.79298-1-sj@kernel.org
- Support cleaning sysfs input files up to committed values
- implement pause/resume of kdamonds
- holistic heterogenous memory management
  - address CPU-numa, CXL-numa, and device(e.g., GPU)-numa nodes
- DAMON_LRU_SORT auto-tuning
  - Let auto-tuning using active/inactive memory ratio
- Selftests: Test DAMON online tuning
- Selftests: Test DAMOS online tuning
- Selftests: Test DAMOS filter
- Make 'age' counted by sample_interval rather than aggregation interval
- CPU time quota for DAMON monitirng
- monitoring part CPU usage statistics
- Setting resolution of damos tried_regions
  - Should be able to control the directories population overhead when the
    number of regions is big
- More DAMON modules
  - DAMON-based THP hinting module
- rename nr_accesses/moving_accesses_bp
- mark nr_accesses as private
- use a dedicated struct for access rate
- let kdamond name be user-defined
- let DAMON modules share one kdamond
- unify DAMON modules
- support multiple contexts per kdamond
- DAMON-based VMA split/merge
  - Help big VMA contention issue?
  - We can further expose the monitoring results via vma name
  - Reading results becomes very easy
- Contig memory access util monitoring
- WSS/RSS based processes sorting
- LRU-based monitoring ops
- automatic paddr regions detection
  (handle hot(un)plugged memory regions)
- Fixed granularity idleness monitoring
  - Must be useful for further DAMON overhead/accuracy evaluation
- Improve regions-based monitoring quality
- Support cgroups
- Support tlb flushing
  - https://lore.kernel.org/all/a2fb10bd-b44a-350e-f693-82ecfa6f54a8@huawei.com/
- Add __counted_by() annotation when ready
  (https://lore.kernel.org/r/CAKwvOdkvGTGiWzqEFq=kzqvxSYP5vUj3g9Z-=MZSQROzzSa_dg@mail.gmail.com)
- Ideas from LSFMM
  - Add operations driven access check
    - Let it calls DAMON functions for noticed access and then let DAMON records
      the access
  - Take care of fairness on ACMA (e.g., NUMA)
- Consider hugetlb handling optimization
  - DAMON_RECLAIM will meaninglessly try reclaiming hugetlb pages, consume
    CPUs.  Find a way to optimize.
- DAMON in process context
  - Do the monitoring for each process in task_work context, like NUMA
    balancing installs prot_none.
