WIP
---

- DAMON sysfs cleanup, for online tuning
  - maybe not aim to be merged in 6.10
- Access/Contiguity-aware Memory Auto-scaling
  - https://lore.kernel.org/damon/20240512193657.79298-1-sj@kernel.org
- Documentation cleanup: Make link from design to API, usage
- write-only monitoring
  - There is a patch doing the work already:
    https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20220203131237.298090-1-pedrodemargomes@gmail.com/
  - soft_dirty is not supported on every architecture; using write-protect
    fault directly might be an option
- Selftests: Test DAMOS tried_regions

Planning / Considering
----------------------

- implement pause/resume of kdamonds
- holistic heterogenous memory management
  - address CPU-numa, CXL-numa, and device(e.g., GPU)-numa nodes
- DAMON_LRU_SORT auto-tuning
  - Let auto-tuning using active/inactive memory ratio
- Documentation cleanup: Move more conceptual technical detail to design
- DAMON sysfs interface refactoring
  - Make the dirty callback based implementation simple
    - Have a purpose-driven callback?
  - Move scheme update to core logic
- Selftests: Test DAMON online tuning
- Selftests: Test DAMOS online tuning
- Selftests: Test DAMOS filter
- Make 'age' counted by sample_interval rather than aggregation interval
- CPU time quota for DAMON monitirng
- monitoring part CPU usage statistics
- onetime callback
  - manually setting callback function pointers looks dangeraous.  Provide more
    decent interface, like register/unregister_damon_callback, and one time
    callback like call_rcu()
- Setting resolution of damos tried_regions
  - Should be able to control the directories population overhead when the
    number of regions is big
- More DAMON modules
  - DAMON_WSS: Yet another DAMON module for WSS monitoring with ro/wo/rw
  - DAMON-based THP hinting module
- DAMON debugfs deprecation: make it stop working
- DAMON debugfs deprecation: remove code
- rename nr_accesses/moving_accesses_bp
- mark nr_accesses as private
- use a dedicated struct for access rate
- let kdamond name be user-defined
- let DAMON modules share one kdamond
- unify DAMON modules
- support multiple contexts per kdamond
- DAMON-based VMA split/merge
  - Help big VMA contention issue?
  - We can further expose the monitoring results via vma name
  - Reading results becomes very easy
- Contig memory access util monitoring
- WSS/RSS based processes sorting
- LRU-based monitoring ops
- rename damon_sysfs_scheme to damos_sysfs
- automatic paddr regions detection
  (handle hot(un)plugged memory regions)
- Fixed granularity idleness monitoring
  - Must be useful for further DAMON overhead/accuracy evaluation
- Improve regions-based monitoring quality
- Support cgroups
- Support tlb flushing
  - https://lore.kernel.org/all/a2fb10bd-b44a-350e-f693-82ecfa6f54a8@huawei.com/
- Add __counted_by() annotation when ready
  (https://lore.kernel.org/r/CAKwvOdkvGTGiWzqEFq=kzqvxSYP5vUj3g9Z-=MZSQROzzSa_dg@mail.gmail.com)
- Ideas from LSFMM
  - Add operations driven access check
    - Let it calls DAMON functions for noticed access and then let DAMON records
      the access
  - Take care of fairness on ACMA (e.g., NUMA)


Recently Done
-------------

- page granularity access double check filter

  - merged in mainline
- Selftests: Test DAMOS quota goals
  - merged in mainline
