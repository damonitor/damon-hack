WIP
---

- DAMON debugfs deprecation: make it unignorable
  - Build-time unignorable: Add '_DEPRECATED' to CONFIG_DAMON_DBGFS name
  - Runtime unignorable: Rename 'monitor_on' to 'monitor_on_DEPRECATED'

Aiming next merge window
------------------------

- Self feedback based DAMOS tuning
- Selftests: Test quota

Planning / Considering
----------------------

- Access/Contiguity-aware Memory Auto-scaling
  - https://lore.kernel.org/damon/20231112195114.61474-1-sj@kernel.org/
- Make 'age' counted by sample_interval rather than aggregation interval
- CPU time quota for DAMON monitirng
- monitoring part CPU usage statistics
- onetime callback
  - manually setting callback function pointers looks dangeraous.  Provide more
    decent interface, like register/unregister_damon_callback, and one time
    callback like call_rcu()
- Setting resolution of damos tried_regions
  - Should be able to control the directories population overhead when the
    number of regions is big
- More DAMON modules
  - DAMON_WSS: Yet another DAMON module for WSS monitoring with ro/wo/rw
  - DAMON-based THP hinting module
- DAMON debugfs deprecation: make it stop working
- DAMON debugfs deprecation: remove code
- rename nr_accesses/moving_accesses_bp
- mark nr_accesses as private
- use a dedicated struct for access rate
- let kdamond name be user-defined
- let DAMON modules share one kdamond
- unify DAMON modules
- write-only monitoring
  - There is a patch doing the work already:
    https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20220203131237.298090-1-pedrodemargomes@gmail.com/
  Need to wait until soft-dirty bugs are fixed, though.
- support multiple contexts per kdamond
- DAMON-based VMA split/merge
  - Help big VMA contention issue?
  - We can further expose the monitoring results via vma name
  - Reading results becomes very easy
- Contig memory access util monitoring
- WSS/RSS based processes sorting
- LRU-based monitoring ops
- rename damon_sysfs_scheme to damos_sysfs
- automatic paddr regions detection
  (handle hot(un)plugged memory regions)
- Fixed granularity idleness monitoring
  - Must be useful for further DAMON overhead/accuracy evaluation
- Improve regions-based monitoring quality
- Support cgroups
- Support tlb flushing
  - https://lore.kernel.org/all/a2fb10bd-b44a-350e-f693-82ecfa6f54a8@huawei.com/
- Add __counted_by() annotation when ready
