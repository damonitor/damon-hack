TODOs
=====

- rolling nr_accesses
  - let nr_accesses for last aggregation interval always accessable
- more intervals
  - Let regions adjustment and schemes applying independent of aggreagtion
    intervals by adding adjustment interval and schemes apply interval.
  - with the new intervals, regions adjustment and schemes applying would need
    to use rolling nr_accesses
- Setting resolution of damos tried_regions
  - Should be able to control the directories population overhead when the
    number of regions is big

misc
----

- remove obsolete faqs
- rename damon_sysfs_scheme to damos_sysfs
- implement sz_regions_sum file under schemes/regions/
- add maintainer-entry-profile.rst
- document all features under design doc
- merge DAMON userspace tool in kernel tree

Off the top of the head during LPC
----------------------------------

- Contig memory access util monitoring
- WSS/RSS based processes sorting
- LRU-based monitoring ops

By Priorities
-------------

- Autotuning for DAMOS
  - Provide feedback sysfs file: Users could set values, or special keyword
    - keyword psi makes it works like TMO
  - Set watermarks based on min_freebytes
  - Might be reusing quota is better way
    - quota_user_score: User feedback as a quota
    - quota_psi_mem: Memory PSI as a quota
    - quota_lru_balance: Active/Inactive or LRU gens balance (for lru_prio)
    - The quota internal algorithm would need to be improved, though
    - Quota analygy is not that sounds well for lru balance.
    - 'aim' might be a better naming
    - schemes/0/aim/{metric,target,feed}
    - Should allow manual driving, too

- Write-only monitoring
  There is a patch doing the work already: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20220203131237.298090-1-pedrodemargomes@gmail.com/
  Need to wait until soft-dirty bugs are fixed, though.

- Unify DAMON_RECLAIM and DAMON_PLRUS

- Multiple contexts per kdamond
  (to avoid interference between different contexts)

- Monitoring time quota
  Let users set time quota and automatically adjust
  {min,max}_nr_regions based on the time usage (per-context).

- Automatic paddr regions detection
  (handle hot(un)plugged memory regions)

- DAMON-based Compaction Target Scanning

- Fixed granularity idleness monitoring
  - Must be useful for further DAMON overhead/accuracy evaluation

- DAMON-based THP hinting

- Improve regions-based monitoring quality

- Support cgroups

By Categorization
-----------------

DAMON Improvement
 - page-gran monitoring
 - accuracy improvement
 - more address spaces: read/write, numa, cgroups, files
 - intuitive overhead unit (CPU time quota instead of nr_{min,max}_regions)

DAMOS Improvement
 - more actions: THP, NUMA migration, ...
 - denylist
 - autotuning: feedback sysfs file accepting values and special keywords
   - writing big value makes the scheme more aggressive and vice versa
   - writing PSI_TMO makes it works like DAMON-based TMO
